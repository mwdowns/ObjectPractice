#Practice with Objects in Python

When I've tried teaching myself to code or taken online courses for Python in the past, Objects have *usually* been the place where I hit the wall and got frustrated and then gave up.

When doing these exercises, though, I seemed to have recalled my memories of past learning and things clicked a little bit better. Maybe there is hope for me in programming after all!
